# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tourist Hub API backend will serve as the core system for a web and mobile application that facilitates complex tour management and collaboration between tourists and tour providers. The system supports three distinct user roles with role-based access control: System Administrators with full system access, Provider Administrators managing company-specific operations, and Tourists managing their personal profiles and tour participation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to manage all users and companies in the system, so that I can maintain overall system integrity and provide comprehensive administrative oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a System Administrator accesses the user management interface THEN the system SHALL display all users across all companies with full CRUD capabilities

3. WHEN a System Administrator manages tour templates THEN the system SHALL allow creation, editing, and deletion of reusable tour templates with site details
4. WHEN a System Administrator sets allowed tourist numbers for tour events THEN the system SHALL enforce these limits during tourist registration
5. IF a System Administrator creates default activity types THEN the system SHALL make these available to all Provider Administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Provider Administrator, I want to manage my company's tour operations and tourist registrations, so that I can deliver organized tour experiences for my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Provider Administrator accesses the system THEN the system SHALL only display data and operations related to their specific company
2. WHEN a Provider Administrator creates a custom tour event THEN the system SHALL base it on available tour templates and enforce business rules
3. WHEN a Provider Administrator manages daily schedules THEN the system SHALL support both Gregorian and Islamic date formats
4. WHEN a Provider Administrator reviews tourist registrations THEN the system SHALL provide approval/rejection capabilities with status tracking
5. WHEN a Provider Administrator uploads documents for tourists THEN the system SHALL only allow access to tourists within their company

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Tourist, I want to register for tours and manage my profile and documents, so that I can participate in organized tour experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Tourist registers for a tour event THEN the system SHALL only allow one active registration per time period
2. WHEN a Tourist uploads documents to their profile THEN the system SHALL support Passport, Ticket, Tour Form, and Other document types with descriptions
3. WHEN a Tourist downloads tour calendars THEN the system SHALL provide current schedule information in accessible formats
4. WHEN a Tourist manages their profile THEN the system SHALL validate all required personal information including passport details
5. IF a Tourist's registration is pending THEN the system SHALL prevent registration for other overlapping tour events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As any authenticated user, I want secure access to the system based on my role, so that I can perform authorized operations while maintaining data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate THEN the system SHALL verify credentials and issue appropriate access tokens
2. WHEN a user accesses any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate their authorization based on role and data ownership
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing further operations
4. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the security event
5. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions consistently across all operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want reliable document management capabilities, so that I can securely store and retrieve important tour-related documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file type, size, and associate it with the correct user profile
2. WHEN documents are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain secure file storage with appropriate access controls
3. WHEN users download documents THEN the system SHALL verify permissions and provide secure file access
4. WHEN blank tour forms are requested THEN the system SHALL provide current template versions
5. IF document storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL notify users and prevent additional uploads

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Provider Administrator, I want to create and manage daily activity schedules for tour events, so that tourists have detailed itineraries for their tours.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating daily schedules THEN the system SHALL support both Gregorian and Islamic calendar dates
2. WHEN adding activities to schedules THEN the system SHALL use predefined activity types and allow custom descriptions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system stakeholder, I want comprehensive API documentation and consistent endpoint design, so that integration and maintenance are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are designed THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions with consistent resource naming
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use standardized JSON schemas with proper error handling
3. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL provide complete OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
4. WHEN data validation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid requests
5. IF API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle high user loads and provide reliable performance, so that users have a consistent experience during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under acceptable thresholds
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use efficient queries and appropriate indexing
3. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent uploads without data corruption
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than failing
5. IF system monitoring detects issues THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
