# Tour Event Update Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task 12.2 "Implement tour event update notifications" which adds comprehensive notification triggers for tour event changes, tourist notifications for schedule updates, and notification delivery tracking with retry logic.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tour Event Update Notification Triggers

#### Modified Services:
- **CustomTourEventService** (`src/services/custom-tour-event.ts`)
  - Added notification triggers to the `updateTourEvent` method
  - Detects different types of changes (schedule, capacity, general details, status)
  - Sends appropriate notifications based on change type
  - Added helper method `buildUpdateMessage` for general tour updates

#### Notification Types Implemented:
1. **Schedule Update Notifications**: Triggered when `startDate` or `endDate` changes
2. **Capacity Update Notifications**: Triggered when `numberOfAllowedTourists` changes
3. **General Update Notifications**: Triggered when other tour details change
4. **Cancellation Notifications**: Triggered when tour status changes to CANCELLED

### 2. Activity Update Notification Triggers

#### Modified Services:
- **ActivityService** (`src/services/activity.ts`)
  - Added notification triggers to `createActivity`, `updateActivity`, and `deleteActivity` methods
  - Added helper method `notifyActivityChange` to handle activity-related notifications
  - Sends notifications for activity additions, updates, and cancellations

#### Activity Notification Types:
1. **Activity Added**: When new activities are created for a tour event
2. **Activity Updated**: When existing activities are modified
3. **Activity Cancelled**: When activities are deleted from a tour event

### 3. Notification Delivery and Tracking

#### Features Implemented:
- **Automatic Notification Sending**: All notifications are sent automatically when tour events or activities are modified
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Notifications can be sent via email, push notifications, and in-app messages
- **Error Handling**: Notification failures are logged but don't prevent the main operation from completing
- **Delivery Tracking**: Notification delivery status is tracked and can be queried
- **Retry Logic**: Failed notifications can be identified and retried

#### Integration Points:
- Uses existing `TourEventNotificationService` for sending notifications
- Integrates with `NotificationManager` for delivery tracking
- Supports all notification channels and priority levels

### 4. Business Logic Integration

#### Tour Event Updates:
- Notifications are only sent to tourists with APPROVED registrations
- Different notification types are triggered based on the type of change
- Provider company name is included in notifications when available
- Notifications are sent asynchronously to avoid blocking the main operation

#### Activity Updates:
- Notifications are sent to all approved tourists registered for the tour event
- Activity details (name, date, time, location) are included in notifications
- Different messages are generated for added, updated, and cancelled activities

### 5. Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests:
- **TourEventNotificationService Tests** (`src/tests/services/tour-event-notifications.test.ts`)
  - Tests all notification methods with various scenarios
  - Tests error handling and graceful failure scenarios
  - Tests notification options and multi-channel delivery

#### Integration Tests:
- **Tour Event Notifications Integration Tests** (`src/tests/integration/tour-event-notifications.integration.test.ts`)
  - Tests complete notification workflows
  - Tests tour event lifecycle notifications
  - Tests activity management notifications
  - Tests notification delivery tracking and retry logic
  - Tests error handling and resilience scenarios

### 6. Key Features

#### Notification Triggers:
- **Automatic**: Notifications are triggered automatically when tour events or activities are modified
- **Conditional**: Only sends notifications when there are actual changes that affect tourists
- **Targeted**: Only sends notifications to tourists with approved registrations
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all types of tour event and activity changes

#### Delivery Features:
- **Multi-Channel**: Supports email, push, and in-app notifications
- **Priority-Based**: Different notification types have appropriate priority levels
- **Retry Support**: Failed notifications can be identified and retried
- **Statistics**: Delivery statistics are available for monitoring

#### Error Handling:
- **Non-Blocking**: Notification failures don't prevent tour event or activity updates
- **Logging**: All notification errors are logged for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even if notifications fail

## Usage Examples

### Tour Event Updates
When a provider admin updates a tour event:
```typescript
// This will automatically trigger appropriate notifications
const updatedEvent = await customTourEventService.updateTourEvent(
  tourEventId,
  { startDate: newStartDate, endDate: newEndDate },
  requestingUserId,
  UserType.PROVIDER_ADMIN,
  providerId
);
```

### Activity Management
When activities are added, updated, or deleted:
```typescript
// These will automatically trigger activity notifications
await activityService.createActivity(activityData, userId, userType, providerId);
await activityService.updateActivity(activityId, updateData, userId, userType, providerId);
await activityService.deleteActivity(activityId, userId, userType, providerId);
```

### Notification Tracking
To check notification delivery status:
```typescript
const stats = tourEventNotificationService.getNotificationStats();
const failedNotifications = tourEventNotificationService.getFailedNotifications();
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation fulfills requirement 6.3 from the requirements document:
- ✅ **Schedule Updates**: Tourists are notified when schedules are updated
- ✅ **Notification Delivery**: Comprehensive notification delivery system with tracking
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Failed notifications can be identified and retried
- ✅ **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing tour event and activity management

## Technical Architecture

### Notification Flow:
1. **Trigger**: Tour event or activity is modified
2. **Detection**: Service detects what type of change occurred
3. **Filtering**: Only approved tourists are selected for notifications
4. **Sending**: Appropriate notification type is sent via TourEventNotificationService
5. **Tracking**: Delivery status is tracked by NotificationManager
6. **Retry**: Failed notifications can be retried if needed

### Error Handling Strategy:
- Notification errors are caught and logged
- Main operations (tour event/activity updates) continue even if notifications fail
- Failed notifications are tracked for potential retry
- System remains resilient to notification service issues

## Conclusion

The tour event update notifications system is now fully implemented with comprehensive coverage of all tour event and activity changes. The system provides reliable, multi-channel notifications with proper error handling and delivery tracking, ensuring tourists stay informed about changes to their tour experiences.
